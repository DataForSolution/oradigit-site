      Many AI initiatives fail not because the model is wrong, but because the delivery pipeline is missing. Without reproducibility, monitoring, and governance, even the best algorithms stall before creating real value.

    <h2>What is MLOps?</h2>
    <p>
      MLOps—short for Machine Learning Operations—is the discipline of applying DevOps principles to the AI lifecycle. It ensures that models can be developed, deployed, and maintained reliably in production.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Pillars of MLOps at OraDigit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Version Control for Models & Data:</strong> Full traceability for datasets, features, and model artifacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment:</strong> Automated builds, tests, and deployments.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring & Alerts:</strong> Track drift, latency, and performance over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance & Compliance:</strong> Ensure adherence to industry standards (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA guidance).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling AI Across the Enterprise</h2>
    <p>
      MLOps enables organizations to move beyond one-off projects. By creating standardized pipelines and reusable components, AI can be applied across business units—from imaging analytics in healthcare to predictive maintenance in manufacturing.
    </p>
