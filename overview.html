    <h2>From Formula 1 Speed to Boardroom Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      OraDigit was born at the intersection of velocity and precision. Like the real-time world of motorsports, our origins lie in systems where data is not just collected—but acted on. That mindset powers our approach to transformation: combining deep domain expertise with data science, machine learning, and scalable architecture.

    <h2>What Is Hybrid Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      We define hybrid intelligence as the seamless fusion of human creativity with technological foresight. It’s a philosophy that drives everything we build: from strategy frameworks to causal AI models, digital twins to adaptive IoT systems. In a world of uncertainty, we help you operate with clarity.
